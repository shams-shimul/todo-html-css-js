# Another, but not your average, To-Do!

Yes, you heard it right. Because this app does not just logs your to-do items into the local storage of the browser, and deletes them when commanded, it does a lot more things including:

 - Displays the current date and moving time 'loudly' to keep you reminded of that you're doing nothing, dude!
 - Logging the creation time along with each item
 - Searching through the list
 - Filtering items based on completion status (Done/Not Done)
 - Combining search with completion status to perform even more sophisticated filtering of the list
 - Batch processing the list (marking/unmarking/deleting all at once)
 - Editing multiple items at the same time and accurately keeping track of what changes made to which item
 - Showing beautiful alerts on certain actions (add/update/delete)
 - Fully responsive layout across all the screen sizes (I hope!)
 - Pleasing eyes with soothing meteor rain effects, beautiful gradients, and a few color shifting animations

Coded purely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Took me ages longer than what I initially expected, nonetheless I'm happy that finally I've been able to finish it.
